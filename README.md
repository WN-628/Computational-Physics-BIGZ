# Computational Physics BASIS
Coding projects in Capstone Science: Computational Physics course in BASIS:

- Use Python: **Numpy** and **matplotlib** to do:
  - Integration
  - Integration with Euler's Method
  - Find the best fit polynomial with Lagrange's Method
  - Finding the line of best fit
  - Using Eular's Forward Scheme to solve ODEs
-  Use VPython:
  - Build an animation of a pendulum hang by a string
  - Build an animation for two pendulums connected by a string in the middle
